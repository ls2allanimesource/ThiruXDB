## Features

- **Endpoint Manager** — Add, edit, activate/deactivate, and delete API endpoints with support for `None`, `Bearer`, `API Key`, and `Basic` authentication
- **Dynamic Path Variables** — Automatically orchestrate mass API fetching by injecting variables (like `{id}`) into URLs from another MongoDB collection's fields.
- **Custom Collections** — Store fetched data in a central `data_records` collection or automatically route it to dedicated custom collections.
- **Field Mappings** — Map and transform response fields (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `date`) to a unified schema
- **One-click Fetch** — Pull data from a single endpoint or all active endpoints at once, with robust background fault tolerance and error skipping.
- **Cancellable & Resumable Sync** — Safely cancel active data syncs without corrupting data. Progress states (like `partial`) are stored persistently and seamlessly resume on refresh.
- **Ultra-Fast Database Insertion** — Automatically batches operations into memory and leverages MongoDB's `bulkWrite` API to insert thousands of records simultaneously at absolute maximum wire speed.
- **Data Browser** — Paginated table/grid view with date range filters, endpoint filtering, and full-text search.
- **Fetch Logs** — Complete history of every fetch operation with status, record counts, duration, and errors. Includes granular deletion and "Clear All" features to manage history.
- **High-Performance Dashboard** — Live stats cached directly on endpoint documents for instantaneous rendering of total records, active endpoints, and distributions.
- **Export** — Download current view as JSON or CSV
- **Mobile Responsive** — Fully optimized UI with sidebar overlays and responsive grids for managing data on the go.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** — Three-tier permission system (`admin`, `editor`, `viewer`) utilizing JWTs and bcrypt password hashing.
- **Activity & IP Auditing** — Comprehensive user activity logs with automatic IP Geolocation (`ip-api.com`), tracking ISPs, Cities, and Device information.
- **Frappe UI "Espresso" Aesthetic** — Sleek, flat design layout natively built in React + Tailwind.
- **Global Light/Dark Mode** — Fully responsive theme switching that persists in local storage.
- **Local Auth** — Simple session-based admin login (no external auth service required)

## Sync Engine Architecture & Deployment

ThiruXDB uses a highly optimized, state-persistent A self-hosted API data aggregation dashboard — configure external REST endpoints, fetch & store their data into MongoDB, browse and search records, all from a clean web UI. designed to handle large payloads (20MB+) while gracefully tolerating Serverless environments.

- **MongoDB State Tracking:** Sync progress is stored centrally in the `sync_jobs` collection. This allows multi-container Serverless environments (like Netlify or Vercel) to auto-scale without losing track of your download's progress or speed.
- **Detached Promise Execution:** By default, the engine spins up the sync as a detached background promise. This operates flawlessly out-of-the-box on any standard **VPS** or persistent Node.js environment.
- **Serverless Environments (Vercel):** When deployed to standard serverless functions (which strictly freeze upon HTTP response), the sync engine utilizes a "freeze and thaw" mechanism. The engine will pause execution when the function sleeps, and will instantly resume exactly where it left off when the frontend's 1-second UI polling tickles the container awake. (Note: this is perfectly safe, but will result in slower download speeds compared to a VPS).

> [!WARNING]
> **Cloudflare Pages / Workers are NOT supported.** The Express backend uses the native `mongodb` Node.js driver, which requires raw TCP socket access (`net` and `tls` modules). Cloudflare's V8 Isolates do not support these modules, meaning the backend will instantly crash if deployed to Cloudflare. Please use **Netlify**, **Vercel**, or a **VPS**.
- **Netlify Background Functions:** If `process.env.NETLIFY` is detected, the API will automatically route the sync task to a dedicated Netlify Background Function (`netlify/functions/sync-background.js`). This entirely bypasses the 10-second timeout freeze, running at full line-speed for up to 15 minutes!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) `>= 1.0`
- A MongoDB instance — [MongoDB Atlas free tier](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) works great

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThiruXD/Endpoint-URL-Migration-To-MongoDB.git
cd Endpoint-URL-Migration-To-MongoDB
bun install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
MONGODB_DB=thiruXDB
PORT=3001
VITE_ADMIN_USERNAME=your_username_here
VITE_ADMIN_PASS=your_password_here
```

> **Note:** Bun loads `.env` automatically — no `dotenv` package required.

### 3. Run in Development

```bash
bun run dev
```

This starts both servers concurrently:
- **Vite** (frontend) → `http://localhost:5173`
- **Express API** → `http://localhost:3001`

Vite proxies all `/api/*` requests to the Express server, so the frontend just calls `/api/...`.

### 4. Login

Default credentials (change in `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`):

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Username | `your_username` |
| Password | `your_password` |
